# CHAT APP [ SOCKET IO AND NODE JS]

## ABOUT
The chat application is a simple backend application built using socket-io and node js. A client side has been built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. The server runs on the port 3000.

## FEATURES
The server side uses `socket.io and node js` to create a websocket server for bidirectional communication with the client. 
The connection in the server is an asynchronous process which deals with multiple requests from the client side asynchronously. The server runs on the port 3000.



Once the connection is established, the socket associated with the client side is used for emmiting and handling events in the server side.
